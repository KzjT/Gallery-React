Simulator of an e-commerce of an art gallery. It has filtering by categories which allows you to view the products in a more organized way.

## Libraries

Here are the key libraries and technologies used in this project:

- **[React](https://es.reactjs.org/)**: We use React as the main library to build the UI of the application. React is a widely used JavaScript library for creating reusable and dynamic components.

- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: We employ React Router for in-app navigation and routing. This allows us to create routes and manage navigation between pages efficiently.

- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Firebase is used as a backend platform and real-time database to store data, authenticate users, and manage application flow

- **[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)**: We've leveraged React Bootstrap to streamline UI development. This library provides predefined components and styles that integrate seamlessly with React.

- **[React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/)**: We use React Toastify to display notifications to the user, such as success messages, warnings or errors, in an elegant and effective way.

- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)**: Sass is used for managing styles in the application. It allows for more structured and modular writing of CSS, making it easier to maintain and customize styles.

- **[MUI (Material-UI)](https://mui.com/)**: We have incorporated MUI (Material-UI) for certain components and styles of the application. MUI provides Material Design-based user interface components that are attractive and functional.
